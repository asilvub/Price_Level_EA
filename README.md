# Euro Area Price Levels 

This repository plots price levels for Euro Area countries. I collected data from EuroStat. Series correspond to the Harmonized Index of Consumer Price (HICP). I provide them as a compressed files. You can also download them <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/prc_hicp_midx/default/table?lang=en&category=prc.prc_hicp"> at this link </a>. 

I did this motivated by John Cochrane's post on <a href="https://www.grumpy-economist.com/p/inflation-and-relative-prices"> Inflation and Relative Prices</a>.
